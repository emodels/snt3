The importance of human resource planning to the success of any business enterprise is well recognized. Equally accepted is the fact that certain skills do not exist in sufficient numbers today and can be hard to find. The need to recruit offshore is immediately apparent.</p>
                        <p class="justify">This can bring its own complications, and Clients must employ a robust and thorough process not only to hire the best from around the world, but also to retain them.</p>
                        <p class="justify">
                            Hiring or staffing offshore may be needed for a variety of reasons.
                            You may need a very specific skill where you are, but it not available in your country. So you search internationally and want the successful candidate to come and work with you.
                            You may need a skill set for a job in your overseas plant but you are unsure how to recruit top talent locally with confidence.
                            You may need a more specific skill set that is not available in a third-world market, but is generally available in a developed market.
                            Each situation has its own best solution.
                        </p>
